This allowed me to keep the dictionaries containing movie information and load them again when the program requests it. \n",

The 'clear_ouput' import was for when I wanted to clear the terminal of any information. This was purely for keeping the console clean and focused.\n",

It is important for me to code the program in the order that I think the user will most likely use it. The order is also important for displaying information in the correct order. The following two methods, create_dict() and create_initial_dict() was my solution to a problem I struggled with.

    "The file_menu() function was the most challenging part of this program. I went through multiple iterations of this function to test how different formats reacted when read from the text file. I quickly learnt that reading multiple dictionaries from a text file and displaying them according to a numeric value was not easy. Reading a list containing dictionaries from a file with the .read() method was not a viable method for what I wanted to achieve. \n",
    "\n",
    "The function begins with testing if there is any data written on the text file. If not, it prompts the user to press 'B' to go back to the main menu as there is no data to work with. If there is data on the file, it is assigned onto the 'data' variable to be worked with. As I am requesting the movie information in JSON and dumping it as such into a file, it is important that I also load the information from the file using the json.load() method. This means that there was no conversion of the data between it being dumped to the file and it being loaded to a variable to be displayed. An additional feature I implemented was calculating the average metascore of all movies on the file. This was done using the for loop that read out the movie titles. The program will also determine whether the movie has a metascore and if none is given the movie is excluded from the calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The file menu allows the user to view information on existing movies on the file, to clear the file, or to save the file as is and exit the program. Movies are accessed by entering the numeric value assigned to them with the for loop. To interact with the file and menus the user can enter a select few numbers and strings such as 'X', 'B' and 'S'. In order to validate the input from the user, as they are allowed to enter both strings and integers, I had to make use of an value exception block. This means the user can only enter the values shown to them on the menu. \n",
    "\n",
    "To display a chosen movie's details, the user must enter the option by selecting the movie's corresponding number. The number is generated by taking the length of the 'data' variable, which is the amount of dictionaries in a list within the file.\n",
    "I used a for and while loop to do this. \n",
    "After the movie is selected, its details are shown with the option of pressing 'B' to go back. As data entries within a list start with '0', I had to increment the file postion by one when the user selects the movie and then decrease it by one when calling its location within the list. With this I avoid a situation where the user had to pick a movie numbered 0. \n",

    "*Reflection: I struggled with the different formats. Initially I requested all movie data in xml format from the OMDB API but quickly learnt that when reading in lists or dictionaries from the file, I was only reading in strings and not the dictionaries containing the string elements. This problem was solved using JSON.*"

    "The above two functions perform the same task which is to write data to the 'movie_file.txt' file. However, the first function is only called if there is already data written on the file. The second function, create_initial_dict(), is only called when it is the first movie that is being written onto the text file. Using two seperate functions was my choice, although it was probably not necessary. \n",
    "\n",
    "Both functions receive the movie variable as an argument, it then uses the 'movie' variable, which is a JSON dictionary containing the movie information requested from OMDB, to create a new dictionary with fewer details. The data pulled from the 'movie' variable can be changed depending on what information is needed. With the 'create_intitial_dict()' function, this first dictionary is appended to the 'movie_details' array and *dumped* to the text file. This does two things: \n",
    "1. It creates a list of dictionaries within the text file. This list can now be appended with other dictionaries. \n",
    "2. It allows us to assign a positional value for every movie that has been searched within the text file.\n",
    "Both of these characteristics enables us to better sort and load our movie information.\n",

    "It can also be noted that we open our text file in the 'r+'-mode so that we can both read and write to it when opening it. Opening in 'w'-mode will clear our text file.\n",
    "\n",
    "create_dict() however does not just append dictionaries containing movie information in the traditional sense. For it to add dictionaries to an already defined list in the text file, it has to manually remove the last character in the list (']'). When the last character is removed, thereby opening the list, dumping a new dictionary into the existing list is made possible. The program then has to close the list again. Using 'file.seek()' we can determine where the last character in our text file is located. This way of adding dictionaries is necessary for the program to work.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Reflection: This was a difficult feature to add. I had to scavenge github and stackoverflow for any information related to reading and writing to an already defined dictionary within a file. It almost seemed impossible. I had coded to the point where I could only run the program when the text file was empty, the initial list containing the movie dictionaries would be successfully written to the file but the program could not load it again once another dictionary was added to the file. This was, as I later realised, due to the fact that the program was dumping the new dictionaries after the initially defined list, and not **in** it. The code above solves that problem by opening the list and then dumping the new dictionaries containing movie information.*\n"
