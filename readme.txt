WELCOME TO THE HELP FILE.

LAUNCHING THE PROGRAM:

1. Open the folder containing the .ipynb file.
2. The file named 'movie_file.txt' should be in the same folder and have three movies on it pre-dumped.
3. Install or launch Anaconda Navigator on your PC and click on the Jupyter Notebook launcher.
4. Browse your computer's files and look for the .ipynb file using the Jupyter Notebook interface on your chosen web browser.
5. Click on the .ipynb file to open it in Jupyter Notebook. Wait for the Kernel to start.
6. When running the program for the first, the pip will first have to be installed. This can take a few seconds.
   Tip: Remove the '#' sign in front of the '!{sys.executable} -m pip install omdb' line before running for the first time.
7. With the pip installed the program should now greet you with the first menu screen. This screen should also show the 3 movies on hand.
8. Navigate through the menus using the indicated numbers/letters. You do not have to type the letters in ALL CAPS.

TROUBLESHOOTING:

1. If all the steps above were followed and the program is still not launching, consider restarting the kernel and running the program again.
2. Make sure that you removed the '#' sign in front of the pip installer line. This is the code in the second line from the top.
3. Check your input. Make sure that you are not typing foreign symbols into the input line.
4. If the 'movie_file.txt' file needs to be cleared and you can not access the program, consider deleting the contents manually.
